I've been [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uW3TNDIcAs) for a long time that in this day and age, there is no excuse for not building your own website.

Commonly, I've used the excuse of simply not having enough time to invest in the experiment. After all, building a website from scratch (without the use of WordPress and the likes) is a deeply complicated, convoluted process.

In some ways its easy to learn, but almost impossible to master everything that goes into making a website that not only works, but works *well*, look nice, and doesn't break. Paradoxically, the farther the frontend and backend development worlds accelerate, the more technology they invent to make websites better, the harder it is to start learning about how to actually do any of it.

Fortunately for us, the frontend and backend developer's world isn't the only field that has made incredible strides over the past decade.
