You know I had to do it to them.

For this one, I adapted my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe of all time (the one in [King Arthur's Baking Guide](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-peanut-butter-cookies-recipe)).
Here are the changes I've made:
1. peanut butter has been replaced with **Biscoff Cookie Butter**.
2. doubled the portions
3. cookies came out a little oily, so I've cut down the shortening in this recipe to compensate.
4. the biscoff butter is already a bit sweet I cut out the white sugar, leaving just the brown sugar.

Here's the full recipe. It makes about 48 tiny cookies or like 30 reasonable sized ones.

## ingredients

* 3/4 cup (128g) shortening 
* 1 cup (212g) light brown sugar, packed
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups (296g) Biscoff Cookie Butter
* 3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon fine salt, no iodine

## instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. Combine and beat together shortening, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, and cookie butter.
3. Add flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat until combined, doughlike, and quite stiff.
4. Drop by the spoonful onto the baking sheet. Unless you have no class whatsoever, use a fork to crisscross the top of each cookie.
5. Bake for 10 minutes. Do not bake for 11 minutes, they will be dry and lifeless. Do not bake for 9 minutes, you are stupid and do not know what you are doing. Bake for 10 minutes.
6. Take out, wait like 2 minutes before moving from pan so they don't collapse, then migrate to a wire cooling rack. If one disappears in the great migration, so be it.
