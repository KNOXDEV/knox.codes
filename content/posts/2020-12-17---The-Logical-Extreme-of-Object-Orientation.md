As you might be able to tell, I'm passionate about software design.

To say that learning how to program has been formative for me would be an understatement. If I had to forget every language I've ever learned except one, I would unlearn English and keep C++.

Like all languages, programming is organized into prose and poetry. There's plenty of room on that spectrum for some opinionated organization of ideas. As [stated](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html) by Gerald Jay Sussman: "Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."

Unfortunately, just like spoken language, sometimes the words of others can offend us. We may disagree on phrasing, structure, or even just denounce the message itself.

I myself have some preferences when it comes to how I write code. These preferences are called paradigms 

Today, we will perform a case study of a very unique paradigm.

[Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org/#principles) is the paradigm of object-oriented programming turned into a philosophy and taken to its logical conclusion.
