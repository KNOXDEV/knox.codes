On this page, I provide some links to both relevent things that I have created, as well as other resources you might be interested in.

If you like introductory-level blogging about cybersecurity, check out the frequently-updated official blog of the National Cyber League, [cryptokait.com](https://cryptokait.com/blog/). As an NCL Player Ambassador, I've got [a few articles](https://cryptokait.com/author/aeason97/) on the site that might be interesting.

If you're a college student who enjoys short technical workshops on a wide variety of topics, check out [ACM @ UCSD's official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyjPATFqc3FwOiuqJ2UG1Eg). As a content-producing member of this student org, I have [some workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBQFNJ6s5g) about basic cybersecurity up there as well.

*For resources that aren't a shameless plug for things I've been personally involved in, check out the following.*

Immortal and infamous is the [KrebsOnSecurity blog](https://krebsonsecurity.com/) by Brian Krebs. In the cybersecurity blog universe, KrebsOnSecurity is the center. Combining security advice with true investigative journalism, Brian has earned his place as one of the leading experts in cybersecurity.

Perhaps equally famous is the [LiveOverflow YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflowCTF/featured). LiveOverflow has been making tutorials about basic hacking techniques for many years, and his basic [Binary Exploitation series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN) has probably provided millions of new hackers with their first critical glimpse at the techniques used. Be sure to watch his content soon, while its [still allowed](https://www.malwaretech.com/2019/07/youtubes-new-policy-on-hacking-tutorial-is-a-problem.html) on YouTube.

If you want a wonderful cybersecurity podcast to listen to while driving (or walking 30 minutes across campus just to get food), please check out [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) by Jack Rhysider. There are 80 episodes and *I have listened to them all*. If you have doubts about the relevence of cybersecurity in the modern age, check out [episode 54](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/54/) for a look inside the most destructive act of cyber warfare ever committed. 

Wired Magazine is one of the leading voices in all of tech journalism. To back that up, they have a pretty extensive [security section](https://www.wired.com/category/security/) right on the front page. In particular, I am a fan of the [writings](https://www.wired.com/author/andy-greenberg/) of Senior Writer Andy Greenberg, who is probably the world's leading investigative journelist on Russian hacker groups. 

I'm not personally on Twitter a whole bunch, but the rest of the cybersecurity world sure is! Consider following [SwiftOnSecurity](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity), a surreal combination of memes and strangly philosophic security advice. 

If you plan on staying up to date on security research, most major research institutions have a publications blog. For instance, check out [Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/)'s feed for information about some of the biggest vulnerability discoveries out there.

There are other resources out there, but a huge part of being in cybersecurity is doing your own research. Get out there, and have fun!
