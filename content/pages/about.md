My name is **Aaron James**, and I am a software engineer from San Diego, California. I specialize heavily in cybersecurity, but I maintain a fascination with the entire process of sustainable software development methodologies and best practices.

**Nick Knox** is an alias/handle I use in the security world. For example, my GitHub username is **KNOXDEV**, and my blog is [knox.codes](https://knox.codes).

*Here I am teaching a workshop on web exploitation. As you can see, I am passionate about education and mentorship. See my [links](/pages/links) page for more of the resources I use to teach.*

Ever since I taught myself how to program in 2012, I've been fascinated with the structure and design of programs. I use this blog to communicate my musings, which may be related to any of the following:

* software design and best practices
* team management and organizational structure
* cybersecurity news or educational materials
* general math and science

Occasionally, I may even ramble on about something else entirely. Stick around and maybe you'll find something you like.
